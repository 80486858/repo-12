## Renamed project namespace

You should update the following dependency in your application's `composer.json` file:

Replace:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "dragon-code/laravel-migration-actions": "^3.0"
    }
}
```

with

```json
{
    "require": {
        "dragon-code/laravel-actions": "^4.0"
    }
}
```

Then you need to update the dependencies:

```bash
composer update
```

## Changing the names of console commands

| Old Name                               | New Name                       |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `php artisan make:migration:action`    | `php artisan make:action`      |
| `php artisan migrate:actions`          | `php artisan actions`          |
| `php artisan migrate:actions:install`  | `php artisan actions:install`  |
| `php artisan migrate:actions:fresh`    | `php artisan actions:fresh`    |
| `php artisan migrate:actions:refresh`  | `php artisan actions:refresh`  |
| `php artisan migrate:actions:reset`    | `php artisan actions:reset`    |
| `php artisan migrate:actions:rollback` | `php artisan actions:rollback` |
| `php artisan migrate:actions:status`   | `php artisan actions:status`   |
| `php artisan migrate:actions:upgrade`  | `php artisan actions:upgrade`  |

## `Names::MIGRATE` constant name changed

Replace

```php
DragonCode\LaravelActions\Constants\Names::MIGRATE
```

with

```php
DragonCode\LaravelActions\Constants\Names::ACTIONS
```

## Changed the default name of the table for storing actions

The new table name is `actions`.

You can also specify any name in the application [settings](https://github.com/TheDragonCode/laravel-actions/blob/main/config/actions.php).
