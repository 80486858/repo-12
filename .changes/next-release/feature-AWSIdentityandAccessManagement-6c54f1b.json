    "description": "Make the LastUsedDate field in the GetAccessKeyLastUsed response optional. This may break customers who only call the API for access keys with a valid LastUsedDate. This fixes a deserialization issue for access keys without a LastUsedDate, because the field was marked as required but could be null."
